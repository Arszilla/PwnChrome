# PwnChrome
A small program that grabs saved passwords from Chrome using a vulnerability where saved passwords are vulnerable to 
attacks/grabs when Chrome is closed.

## Requirements
- Python 3.3+
- [pywin32 module](https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32) - The program will automatically install this module if you 
don't have it

## Information
To run the script just launch the `PwnChrome.py` using `python PwnChrome.py`.

The script will automatically detect the operating system (Windows/MacOS/Linux) and if the operating system is Windows, 
it will check if the `pywin32` module is present. If the module isn't present, the script will automatically install it.
Afterwards the script will check if `chrome.exe` is running and if it is, it will kill the task forcefully and silently 
so that it can navigate to Chrome's saved passwords directory and access the saved passwords; which are unprotected 
while Chrome is closed. At that point the script will extract the `url`, `username` and `password` to `PwnChrome.txt` 
which will be placed where `PwnChrome.py` is located at. 

The reason why the script checks if your operating system is Windows' is because `pywin32` can't be installed in MacOS 
or Linux due to `pywin32` requiring Windows due to the module providing access to many of the Windows' APIs for 
Python. I am looking for ways to decrypt OS X Keychain for MacOS and GNOME Keyring or KWallet on Linux.

Written with Python 3.7.
